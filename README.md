ShakespearePy
=============

A project developed on a Raspberry Pi Model B+. Searches an XML file of Shakespeare plays for a provided or random quote and displays the play, speaker, and full speech containing that quote.

Features cross-platform text-to-speech support via the `pyttsx` library as well as caching for speedup, tracked by file hash of the speech file.

## Syntax

````
python ShakespearePi.py [-q|--quiet] [-s|--speak] [-n|--no-cache] [quote]
````

`-q`, `--quiet`: Omit all output except the output speech data.

`-s`, `--speak`: Speak output using the `pyttsx` library after lookup.

`-n`, `--no-cache`: Don't cache to a file or look for one at all before lookup. By default, caching is enabled via the `pickle` library to output a dictionary to a file. The cache tracks the MD5 hash of the lookup file (in `Assets`) - if it has changed, the cache is invalidated and a new one is generated.

`quote`: Input quote to look up. If none is provided, a quote will be chosen at random from `Quotes.py`.
